A recaptcha so easy a bot could do it?

For Engineering Physics 253/480, we had to build a robot that could pick up soda cans and also entertain
This website was used to let the robot click the "I'm not a robot" Recaptcha.
The recaptcha box follows the mouse so that even if the robot displaces the mouse, its still in place to click the recaptcha.
